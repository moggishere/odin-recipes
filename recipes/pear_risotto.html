        <h3>Preparing:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>put a pot with your <strong>vegetable stock</strong> on high heat stove. lower the flames when it starts boiling and keep it warm</li>
            <li>while the stock is heating up ready the rest of the ingredients: peel and dice the <strong>onion</strong> into thin small pieces,
            clean the <strong>pears</strong> without taking out their peel. dice one of them into cubes and put the tiny pieces on a separate bowl soaking on the lemon juice.
            the other pear should be sliced into four pieces </li>
            <li>take a non-stick pan to the stove at medium heat. as it heats up pour <strong>olive oil</strong> and put the 4 pear slices onto it. 
            let the sides rest for 2 minutes each. set it aside as you work on the risotto</li>
            <li>take a medium sized pot to the stove at medium heat. as it heats up, pour some olive oil, throw your <strong>onions</strong> in
             and season them with <strong>salt</strong> and cook them until they soften. add the rice and mix them for a minute until everything is covered with oil.
            season with <strong>salt and pepper</strong> to taste</li>
             <li>pour <strong>white wine</strong> and stir until it dries up. add some of the <strong>vegetable stock</strong> and stir until the rice absorbs it
            . repeat the process until the rice is ready: the grain should be soft on the outer edge but still tough inside. add one last scoop of stock before taking it out, the rice should not be completely dry</li>
            <li>add the <strong>butter</strong>, the <strong>gorgonzola cheese</strong> and <strong>parmesan</strong> to the rice and mix. add the <strong>pear cubes</strong> too, mixing delicately as to not break them. 
            separate the rice into two plates, put <strong>slices of pear on top of each</strong> </li>
        </ol>
